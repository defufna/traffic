# Traffic!

## About

Simple web page that simulates pedestrian traffic light. I made it to teach my
child about traffic lights.

## Requirements

Python 3.4 (it might work on older Python3)

## Usage

Extract all files, navigate to folder and execute:

`python ./traffic.py`

Open http://localhost:8000 in browser.
First click switches to fullscreen, subsequent clicks toggles traffic light status.

Traffic light status is server side variable, if you open page accross multiple
devices they all see and toggle same traffic light.

If you want different port then 8000, pass it as an argument to traffic.py.

`python ./traffic.py 80`
